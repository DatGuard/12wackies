<h2>What is 12wackies?</h2>
    <p>12wackies, based on 8values, 8dreams, and 9axes, is a political quiz that attempts to assign percentages for 24 different wacky off-compass political values. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b> <b>[Unless you wanna go *off the charts* ;)]</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Note that this should not be taken too unironically.<br /><br />
    There are 120 questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What Are The 24 Values?</h2>

<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the eight values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your assigned ideology, send us an email at 8dreams.info@gmail.com with your scores, matched ideology, and preferred ideology, and we'll look into adjusting the system. Thanks!</p>
